# Sugarcane-Production-analysis
This project analyzes global sugarcane production by exploring key factors like production volume, land usage, and yield per hectare across different countries and continents. Through comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), we'll identify top-producing regions, understand relationships between variables, and visualize the distribution of production. The insights gained will help inform agricultural strategies and enhance resource management in the sugarcane industry.
